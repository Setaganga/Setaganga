Hello, I'm Joren/Setaganga!

I'm a 15 year old Backend Developer living in the Denver Area.
I like Guitar, Programming, and Linguistics. I like Soulsborne games and Spaceflight Simulator. I'm a B2 Level of Fluency in Spanish and I also do club Sabre Fencing. I have been programming for about 3 years, which started off with me using Python as a personal tool, but now I am taking it further and expanding my learning exponentially to turn it into my career.

Let's get into my programming side!

My Primary languages I use are Python and Javascript, I use these a lot for just small personal programs, but sometimes I work with them on bigger programs and websites with Django. I'm currently learning React and Redux and I'm also currently enrolled in the Harvard CS50x Computer Science course. I also will soon be signing up for Skillreactor, a fullstack real workplace experience program.

For my experience, I have not had a job as of now, but I have done community service, had leadership in the majority of projects in school, and have always had a creative and fun mind to spice up teamwork. 

School has always been something important to me. I've made sure that I'm never turning in things late, being responsible, owning my mistakes, and keeping my grades high.

As for my future plans, I plan to go to the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO for a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Linguistics. If that's not an option, I might go into Aerospace Engineering and go to the Air Force Academy, or heck even join the space force on my own, because space is cool.

If you'd like to see some of the work I've done, you can check out my portfolio repository, and there I have some cool stuff you can check out.

You can contact me via my email at @nicholasjoren@gmail.com

And thank you for taking the time to check me out!
