Hey guys, I'm Joren/Setaganga!

I'm interested in Guitar, Programming, and Linguistics. I like Soulsborne games and Spaceflight Simulator. I'm a B2 Level in Fluency in Spanish.

I'm currently learning Python and Javascript.
My plans for future language learning include PHP, SQL, and Django.
I plan to go to college for a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Linguistics. If that's not an option, I might go into Aerospace Engineering.

I have a basic understandings of some languages, which are Python, Java, JS, C++, HTML, and CSS.
I have more experience with Python and JS; Python being the language I have the most experience with.
I have been programming for about 3 years and I've made a few games in gamemakerstudio2 for the Technology Student Association (TSA) extracurricular.

I have completed the Python and Javascript courses from w3schools.com, which in essence show that I know the basics of the two languages.
I strive to get certified on freecodecamp.org and hackerrank.com for some back end development, python, and javascript certifications.
These awards mean that I would be very familiar with the language and would have the ability to problem solve and use the language to its fullest.
