Hello, I'm Joren/Setaganga!

I'm a 15 year old Backend Developer living in the Denver Area.
I like Guitar, Programming, and Linguistics. I like Soulsborne games and Spaceflight Simulator. I'm a B2 Level of Fluency in Spanish and I also do club Sabre Fencing. I have been programming for about 3 years, which started off with me using Python as a personal tool, but now I am taking it further and expanding my learning exponentially to turn it into my career.

As stated before, I am aiming for a Backend Job. My expertise is in Python, Javascript, Django, PostgreSQL, and C. Of course I am open to learning new frameworks, libraries, and languages (because frankly it would be fun).

Currently my focus is to try and integrate postgreSQL with my website via python, which I believe is the psycopg2 library. I am also taking cs50x from harvard and will soon take up projects on skillreactor, which is a fullstack real world experience program, where we use a front end and back end of choice, and use git and other things like a professional work environment would.

As for my future plans, I plan to go to the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO for a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Linguistics. If that's not an option, I might go into Aerospace Engineering and go to the Air Force Academy, or heck even join the space force on my own, because space is cool.

For my experience, I have not had a job as of now, but I have done community service, been a leader in the majority of projects in school, and have always had a creative and fun mind to spice up teamwork. School has always been something important to me. I've made sure that I'm never turning in things late, being responsible, owning my mistakes, and keeping my grades high.

If you'd like to see some of the work I've done, you can check out my portfolio repository, and there I have some cool stuff you can check out. I also have a django project, which you can check out the source code for, if you would like.

You can contact me via my email at @nicholasjoren@gmail.com or send me a text over at +1 720-668-2127.

And thank you for taking the time to check me out!
