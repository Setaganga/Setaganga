Hey guys, I'm Joren/Setaganga!

I'm interested in Guitar, Programming, and Linguistics. I like Soulsborne games and Spaceflight Simulator. I'm a B2 Level in Fluency in Spanish

I'm currently learning Python, Javascript, and a wee bit of Front End Development.
I plan to go to college for a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Linguistics. If that's not an option, I might go into Aerospace Engineering.

I have a basic understandings of a lot of languages which are Python, Java, JS, C++, HTML, and CSS.
