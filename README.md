Hey guys, I'm Joren/Setaganga!

I like Guitar, Programming, and Linguistics. I like Soulsborne games and Spaceflight Simulator. I'm a B2 Level of Fluency in Spanish and I also do club Sabre Fencing. I have been programming for about 3 years and I've made a few games in robloxstudio with Roblox LUA and gamemakerstudio2 with GML Javascript for the Technology Student Association (TSA) extracurricular.


Let's get into my programming side!

My Primary languages I use are Python and Javascript, I use these a lot for just personal programs, but sometimes I work with them on like Django or Node (hopefully using a frontend framework soon). I'm currently learning Java and I'm also currently enrolled in the Harvard CS50x Computer Science course. CS50 is great, I love it so much lol.

As for my future plans, I plan to go to the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO for a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Linguistics. If that's not an option, I might go into Aerospace Engineering and go to the Air Force Academy, or heck even join the space force on my own, because space is cool.

If you'd like to see some of the work I've done, you can check out my portfolio repository, and there I have some cool stuff you can check out.

You can contact me via my email at @nicholasjoren@gmail.com

And thank you for taking the time to check me out!
