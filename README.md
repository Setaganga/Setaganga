Hey guys, I'm Joren/Setaganga!

I'm interested in Guitar, Programming, and Linguistics. I like Soulsborne games and Spaceflight Simulator. I'm a B2 Level in Fluency in Spanish.

My Primary languages I use are Python and Javascript.
I'm currently learning SQL.
I'm also currently enrolled in the Harvard CS50x Computer Science course.

I plan to go to college for a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Linguistics. If that's not an option, I might go into Aerospace Engineering.
I also plan to become certified in Back End Development and Scientific Computing with Python for freecodecamp.org

I have been programming for about 3 years and I've made a few games in robloxstudio with Roblox LUA and gamemakerstudio2 with GML Javascript for the Technology Student Association (TSA) extracurricular.
